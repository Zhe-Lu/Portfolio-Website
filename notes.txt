- light/dark theme js implementation 

- big/medium/small focus heiarchy
	- what is the first thing you want people to focus on when they enter you webpage?
	- size/contrast but size more important most of the time
	- theme: sharp/smart/modern

- grid of invisible lines that helps us re-arrange content into lines
	- 12 columns (divisible 2/3/4/6)
	- rows do not matter as much since you can scroll
	- can be used to create order from disorder, check apple home page for example
	- gutter is the space between the columns
		- more gutter for text preferred
		- less gutter is acceptable for images

- although (16:9)/(21:9) monitors exist, we do not want the user to scan from right to left
- use max-width for main container (max 1000px? apple is 1400px but depends)
