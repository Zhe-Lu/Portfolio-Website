static and dynamic websites
https://wpamelia.com/static-vs-dynamic-website/#:~:text=Static%20websites%20are%20ones%20that,databases%20in%20addition%20to%20HTML.
"Static websites use only client-side HTML and CSS code while dynamic websites rely on both client-side and server-side scripting languages such as JavaScript, PHP, or ASP. When a user accesses a dynamic website, the site can be changed through code that is run in the browser and/or on the server. The end result is the same as that on a static website: an HTML page displayed on the web browser."
